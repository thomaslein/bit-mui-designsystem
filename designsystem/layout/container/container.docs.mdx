description: The container centers your content horizontally. It's the most basic layout element.

While containers can be nested, most layouts do not require a nested container.

## Basic usage

A fluid container width is bounded by the `maxWidth` prop value.

```jsx
() => (
  <Container maxWidth="sm">
    <Children />
  </Container>
);
```

## Fixed

If you prefer to design for a fixed set of sizes instead of trying to accommodate a fully fluid viewport, you can set the fixed prop. The max-width matches the min-width of the current breakpoint.

```jsx
() => (
  <Container fixed>
    <Children />
  </Container>
);
```
