description: The Box component is a generic, theme-aware container with access to CSS utilities from MUI System.

import { ThemeProvider } from '@mui/material/styles';
import { Box } from './box.js';

The Box component is a generic container for grouping other components.
It's a fundamental building block when working with Material UIâ€”you can think of it as a `<div>`with extra built-in features, like access to your app's theme and the `sx` prop.

The Box component differs from other containers available in Material UI in that its usage is intended to be multipurpose and open-ended, just like a `<div>`.
Components like Container, Stack and Paper, by contrast, feature usage-specific props that make them ideal for certain use cases: Container for main layout orientation, Stack for one-dimensional layouts, and Paper for elevated surfaces.

## Basic usage

The Box component renders as a `<div>` by default, but you can swap in any other valid HTML tag or React component using the component prop.
The demo below replaces the `<div>` with a `<section>` element:

```js live
() => (
  <Box component="section" sx={{ p: 2, border: '1px dashed grey' }}>
    This Box renders as an HTML section element.
  </Box>
);
```

## The sx prop

Use the `sx` prop to quickly customize any Box instance using a superset of CSS that has access to all the style functions and theme-aware properties exposed in the MUI System package. The demo below shows how to apply colors from the theme using this prop:

```js live
() => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider
      theme={{
        palette: {
          primary: {
            main: '#007FFF',
            dark: '#0066CC',
          },
        },
      }}
    >
      <Box
        sx={{
          width: 100,
          height: 100,
          borderRadius: 1,
          bgcolor: 'primary.main',
          '&:hover': {
            bgcolor: 'primary.dark',
          },
        }}
      />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};
```
