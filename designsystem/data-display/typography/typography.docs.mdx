import { Typography } from './typography.js';

## Basic usage

```js live
() => (
  <>
    <Typography variant="h5">
      The Importance of Using the Right Typography
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant="body1">
      Typography plays a crucial role in shaping user experience in apps. The
      right fonts and text styles not only enhance readability but also convey
      the app's tone and brand identity.
    </Typography>
  </>
);
```

## Customization

This custom Typography component extends the default Typography component with a new variant name `handwriting`.
Follow the same pattern to create your own custom variants or override the existing ones.

See the [material-ui-theme component](https://bit.cloud/kreftregisteret.designsystem/material-ui-theme) to learn how to customize the theme's typography.
