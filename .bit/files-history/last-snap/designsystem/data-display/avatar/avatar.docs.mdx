Avatars are found throughout material design with uses in everything from tables to dialog menus. They are commonly used to represent a user and can contain photos, icons, or even text.

## Basic usage

Provide the `src` prop with a URL to an image to display an image avatar. The `alt` prop is used by screen readers to describe the image.

```js live
() => (
  <Avatar alt="Remy Sharp" src="https://mui.com/static/images/avatar/1.jpg" />
);
```

## Letter avatars

When the `src` prop is not provided, the component will render a letter avatar. You can set the `alt` prop to provide a user-friendly name for the avatar.

```js live
() => <Avatar alt="Remy Sharp">RS</Avatar>;
```

## Group avatars

The `AvatarGroup` component can be used to group multiple avatars together. The `max` prop can be used to limit the number of avatars displayed.

```js live
() => (
  <AvatarGroup max={4}>
    <Avatar alt="Remy Sharp" src="https://mui.com/static/images/avatar/1.jpg" />
    <Avatar
      alt="Travis Howard"
      src="https://mui.com/static/images/avatar/2.jpg"
    />
    <Avatar
      alt="Cindy Baker"
      src="https://mui.com/static/images/avatar/3.jpg"
    />
    <Avatar
      alt="Agnes Walker"
      src="https://mui.com/static/images/avatar/4.jpg"
    />
    <Avatar
      alt="Trevor Henderson"
      src="https://mui.com/static/images/avatar/5.jpg"
    />
  </AvatarGroup>
);
```
