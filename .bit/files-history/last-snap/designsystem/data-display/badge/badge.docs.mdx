Badges are small status descriptors for UI elements. A badge consists of a small circle, typically containing a number or other short set of characters, that appears in proximity to another object. Badges are used to quickly communicate information to users and to urge them to take action.

## Basic usage

The `Badge` component wraps its child(ren) and renders a small circle with a number or other content. The `badgeContent` prop sets the content of the badge. The `color` prop sets the color of the badge.

```js live
() => (
  <Badge badgeContent={4} color="primary">
    <MailIcon />
  </Badge>
);
```

## Color variations

The `color` prop can be used to set the color of the badge.

```js live
() => (
  <Box>
    <Badge badgeContent={4} color="primary">
      <MailIcon />
    </Badge>
    <Badge badgeContent={4} color="secondary">
      <MailIcon />
    </Badge>
    <Badge badgeContent={4} color="error">
      <MailIcon />
    </Badge>
  </Box>
);
```

## Maximum value

The `max` prop can be used to limit the value of the badge content.

```js live
() => (
  <Badge badgeContent={999} color="primary" max={99}>
    <MailIcon />
  </Badge>
);
```
