description: The Material Design responsive layout grid adapts to screen size and orientation, ensuring consistency across layouts.

import Box from '@mui/material/Box';
import { Grid } from './grid.js';
import { Item } from './docs.dev.js';

The grid system is implemented with the Grid component:

- It uses CSS's Flexible Box module for high flexibility.
- There are two types of layout: containers and items.
- Item widths are set in percentages, so they're always fluid and sized relative to their parent element.
- Items have padding to create the spacing between individual items.
- There are five grid breakpoints: xs, sm, md, lg, and xl.
- Integer values can be given to each breakpoint, indicating how many of the 12 available columns are occupied by the component when the viewport width satisfies the breakpoint constraints.

## Basic grid

Column widths are integer values between 1 and 12; they apply at any breakpoint and indicate how many columns are occupied by the component.

A value passed to any given breakpoint also applies to all wider breakpoints (if they have no values explicitly defined). For example, `xs={12}` sizes a component to occupy the full width of its parent container, regardless of the viewport size.

```js live
() => {
  return (
    <Box sx={{ flexGrow: 1 }}>
      <Grid container spacing={2}>
        <Grid
          item
          size={{
            xs: 8,
          }}
        >
          <Item>xs=8</Item>
        </Grid>
        <Grid
          item
          size={{
            xs: 4,
          }}
        >
          <Item>xs=4</Item>
        </Grid>
        <Grid
          item
          size={{
            xs: 4,
          }}
        >
          <Item>xs=4</Item>
        </Grid>
        <Grid
          item
          size={{
            xs: 8,
          }}
        >
          <Item>xs=8</Item>
        </Grid>
      </Grid>
    </Box>
  );
};
```
